Firefox OS D7 Peercoin Tracker
==============================

A simple Firefox OS app that allows you to track your mining progress on the D7 mining pool. This application was originally developed as a Chrome browser extension but was ported over to Firefox OS because it is just that awesome of a platform.

You will need an API key from the D7 mining pool in order for this application to work properly.
